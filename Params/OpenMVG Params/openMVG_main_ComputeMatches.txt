Usage: openMVG_main_ComputeMatches
[-i|--input_file] a SfM_Data file
[-o|--out_dir path] output path where computed are stored

[Optional]
[-f|--force] Force to recompute data]
[-r|--ratio] Distance ratio to discard non meaningful matches
   0.8: (default).
[-g|--geometric_model]
  (pairwise correspondences filtering thanks to robust model estimation):
   f: (default) fundamental matrix,
   e: essential matrix,
   h: homography matrix.
   a: essential matrix with an angular parametrization,
   o: orthographic essential matrix.
   u: upright essential matrix.
[-v|--video_mode_matching]
  (sequence matching with an overlap of X images)
   X: with match 0 with (1->X), ...]
   2: will match 0 with (1,2), 1 with (2,3), ...
   3: will match 0 with (1,2,3), 1 with (2,3,4), ...
[-l]--pair_list] file
[-n|--nearest_matching_method]
  AUTO: auto choice from regions type,
  For Scalar based regions descriptor:
    BRUTEFORCEL2: L2 BruteForce matching,
    HNSWL2: L2 Approximate Matching with Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs,
    ANNL2: L2 Approximate Nearest Neighbor matching,
    CASCADEHASHINGL2: L2 Cascade Hashing matching.
    FASTCASCADEHASHINGL2: (default)
      L2 Cascade Hashing with precomputed hashed regions
     (faster than CASCADEHASHINGL2 but use more memory).
  For Binary based descriptor:
    BRUTEFORCEHAMMING: BruteForce Hamming matching.
[-m|--guided_matching]
  use the found model to improve the pairwise correspondences.
[-c|--cache_size]
  Use a regions cache (only cache_size regions will be stored in memory)
  If not used, all regions will be load in memory.
