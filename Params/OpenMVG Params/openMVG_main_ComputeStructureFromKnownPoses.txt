Compute Structure from the provided poses
Usage: openMVG_main_ComputeStructureFromKnownPoses
[-i|--input_file] path to a SfM_Data scene
[-m|--match_dir] path to the features and descriptors that corresponds to the provided SfM_Data scene
[-o|--output_file] file where the output data will be stored (i.e. path/sfm_data_structure.bin)

[Triangulation mode]:
 [No Provided Matches -> Triangulation of guided epipolar geometry matches (default mode)]
	[-p|--pair_file] path to a pairs file (only those pairs will be considered to compute the structure)
	[-f|--match_file] path to a matches file (loaded pair indexes will be used)
 [Provided Matches -> Robust triangulation of the match file (activated by -d)]
	[-d|--direct_triangulation] Robustly triangulate the tracks computed from the file given by [-f|--match_file]
	[-f|--match_file] path to a matches file (loaded pair indexes will be used)
	[-t|--triangulation_method] triangulation method (default=3):
		0: DIRECT_LINEAR_TRANSFORM
		1: L1_ANGULAR
		2: LINFINITY_ANGULAR
		3: INVERSE_DEPTH_WEIGHTED_MIDPOINT

[Optional]
[-b|--bundle_adjustment] (switch) perform a bundle adjustment on the scene (OFF by default)
[-r|--residual_threshold] maximal pixels reprojection error that will be considered for triangulations (4.0 by default)
[-c|--cache_size]
  Use a regions cache (only cache_size regions will be stored in memory)
  If not used, all regions will be load in memory.
